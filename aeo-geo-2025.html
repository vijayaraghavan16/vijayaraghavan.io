  <h1>AEO and GEO in 2025: How Search Is Shifting from Clicks to Answers</h1>

  <h2>What is AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)?</h2>
  <p>AEO is the process of optimizing your content so that it can directly answer user questions — not just for search engines, but for AI answer engines like Google's SGE, Bing AI, and ChatGPT.</p>

  <h2>What is GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)?</h2>
  <p>GEO takes AEO further. It optimizes your content to be understood and used by generative AI models. These models summarize and answer using structured, clear, and factual content.</p>

  <h2>Why Are AEO and GEO Important in 2025?</h2>
  <p>Search is evolving. AI-generated summaries and instant answers dominate, and traditional SEO tactics alone are no longer enough. AEO and GEO help ensure your content appears in AI-generated responses.</p>

  <h2>How to Optimize for AEO and GEO</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Choose Answerable Topics:</strong> “How to…”, “What is…”, “X vs Y”</li>
    <li><strong>Use Q&A Format:</strong> Structure content with questions and short answers</li>
    <li><strong>Add Schema Markup:</strong> Use FAQ, HowTo, or Article schema</li>
    <li><strong>Show Authority:</strong> Add your name and relevant credentials</li>
    <li><strong>Update Often:</strong> AI favors fresh, relevant content</li>
  </ul>
